# Student Performance EDA using Seaborn

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student academic data using Seaborn.
The goal is to understand score distributions, correlations between subjects, and the impact
of attendance on performance.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Student_ID
- Math marks
- Science marks
- English marks
- Attendance percentage
- Gender

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Computed summary statistics for academic scores
- Analyzed correlations between subjects and attendance
- Compared subject-wise score distributions
- Studied the relationship between attendance and subject performance

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap of academic metrics
- Subject-wise score distribution using box plots
- Scatter plot of attendance vs subject scores with gender grouping

---

## ✅ Key Insights
- Strong correlation observed between Math and Science scores
- Students with higher attendance tend to perform better
- Score distributions vary across subjects

---

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates the use of Seaborn for statistical visualization
and exploratory data analysis, essential for AI and data-driven roles.
